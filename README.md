**Problem Statement: Minimum Spanning Tree and TSP for Metric Graphs with MST Heuristic**

Implement two algorithms for MST and evaluate how the choice of the internal data structure impacts the running time. Then use the
MST algorithm to provide an approximate solution to the famous Traveling Salesman Problem.
